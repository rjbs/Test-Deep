          Test::Deep now co-exists harmoniously with Test::Mock, by not
          calling UNIVERSAL::isa and UNIVERAL::can as functions. (RT#74760,
          Karen Etheridge)

          simple (stringwise) comparison should now be much faster (thanks,
          NCLEATON)

          New maintainer:  Ricardo Signes (rjbs)

          On 5.10.0 and newer perl, install to the "site" directory, not the
          core perl directory in @INC.  (Prior to 5.10.0, @INC ordering was
          unfortunate, and fixing the install target would make upgrading
          difficult.)

          cope with new stringification of qr{} objects in 5.13.x+ (thanks,
          ANDK)

          fix Pod escaping errors (thanks, FWIE)

0.106

          Release after dev.

0.105-dev

          Fix for perl 5.010.1 - the code to check the version and act
          correctly on regexp refs treated .1 as behaving like 5.011.

0.104

          Document behaviour of cmp_bag when a non ARRAY-ref argument is passed
          to it. Explicity test for this a die with a useful message.

          Document and export cmp_details and deep_diag, thanks to Tom Hukins
          for the patch.

0.103

          Detect whether isa() is being called with 1 or 2 arguments and
          dispatch to the correct function. This is hacky but fixes the problem
          of clashing with UNIVERSAL::isa().

0.102

          Behave well when a code comparator doesn't give diagnostics. Thanks
          to Alex Kapranoff.

0.101

          Fix an overloading problem with All and Any. Thanks to Kostas
          Chatzikokolakis for reporting the bug and especially for explaining
          how to fix it :)

          Added a nasty hack to smooth over a problem in Test::Tester.

0.100

          Apply patch from Andreas Koenig (ANDK) to cope with Perl 5.11's new
          REGEXP objects.

0.099

          Don't explode on perl's that don't have weakrefs. If they're not
          available, just don't weaken the refs. It means refs can be cached
          for longer than desirable but it's better than explodiing.

          This doesn't fix all of te problems with perl 5.005 but I'm pushing
          it out because the previous version number upsets CPAN.pm.

0.098

          Cleaned up Test::Deep::NoTest by making it call Test::Deep's import,
          that way it will always be in sync for exports. Also added some POD
          docs.

          Added notest_extra.t to check that things are correctly exported and
          working.

          Add cmp_details but left it undocumented. It manages localising the
          stack etc. Factored eq_deeply and cmp_deeply through that. This meant
          adding an icky hack into deep_diag. I should clean that whole thing
          up.

          Remove $name from params of eq_deeply, in code and docs, it was
          unused.

0.097

          Fixed doc typo for re().

          Fix diagnostics for code(), it was always printing undef instead of
          the got value.

0.096

          %WrapCache was keeping references to external data. It's now
          local()ised at the start of a comparison just like the other caches
          (why I didn't do that when I added it, I don't know). Thanks to
          Matthijs Bomhoff for reporting the problem.

0.095

          Docs and code didn't match, useclass was actually requireclass,
          available as both now

0.094

          Changed Set and Bag to no longer issue warnings when undefs are
          present. Needed to make the sort and the diagnotics
          undef-aware. Thanks to Colin Kuskie for pointing this out.

          Added tests for this.

0.093

          Fixed inifinte recursion when adding comparators into bags. That
          whole area is unpleasant - conceptually as well as
          implementation-wise. Comparators no longer inherit a compare method,
          so we only call the specialised compare if it exists, otherwise we
          just do normal deep comparison.

          Removed a debugging print.

0.092

          Got the if backwards for loading Test::Builder (again for NoTest -
          simples changes...). No ill effects for most people as they load it
          via something else any but ApacheSession for example doesn't.

          Now tetsing for lack of testing framework.

0.091

          Forgot to export lots of stuff via NoTest

0.090

          Added Test::Builder::NoTest so that eq_deeply can be use entirely
          without Test::Builder.

0.089

          Wasn't corrrectly setting $Test::Builder::Level in cmp_bag, cmp_set
          and cmp_methods, this caused test error messages to include the wrong
          line/file.

          Whitespace changes.

0.088

          Slight twiddle to silence warnings from the new Test::Tester thanks to
          SSORICHE

0.087

          cmp_methods, cmp_bag and cmp_set weren't passing on the test name.
          Thanks to Alex Kapranoff for the patch.

0.086

          Add $tolerance to Number so now you can check that 2 numbers are
          equal, give or take a little bit.

          Autogenerating most of the convenience constructor routines, deleted
          nearly 200 lines of boilerplate. Why didn't I think of that before?

          Almost every test script had the same lines at the beginning. These
          are now in t/std.pm, another 200 lines of code (well 50% whitespace)
          gone. Happy.

          Added use warnings to the test scripts, didn't make a difference.

          Added inspection of strings captured from a regex and fixed up some
          re() doc errors.

0.085

          When a hash or array value or amethod does not exist and the expected
          value was a reference, the diagnostics were wrong because it headed
          into Reftype tests. Now Test::Deep::descend catches "Does not exist"
          early on.

          Added listmethods()

0.084

          Added subhashof and superhashof, restructured various Hash modules to
          handle sub and super.

          Got rid of unexported hash_elements from Test::Deep.

          Fixed a problem with circular set comparisons.

0.083

          The cache is more efficient, using a single layer and weak refs, also
          previously it could be fooled by reused addresses for objects (this
          is not just theoretical).

          Now Test::Deep::descend is responsible for pushing onto the stack as
          well as pulling, this means most tests don't need to think about the
          stack at all

          For the stack stuff, had to create lots of "only" modules these are
          tests that should never be called on their own as they make
          assumptions about the validity of the data, they are used as subtests
          inside others

          cleaned up lots of copy and paste Data::Dumper and confess and
          various other bits and pieces

          Test::Deep::Cmp (and it's descendants) autopush themselves onto the
          stack of any Test::Deep::* that uses them. Cuts even more cruft.

          Now everything uses the compare in Test::Deep::Cmp which just does a
          deep comparison. This is not perfect for All and Set but it's as good
          as what was happeneing before now.

          Wrapping unknown reftypes as shallow

0.082

          Got rid of silly use lib in the tests, shouldn't have been in public

          Added dependency on Test::More

          Moved from type =>, vals => to exp =>, got => in stack entries

          Individual descend()s no longer pop their data from the stack, that's
          taken care of by Test::Deep::descend. This made things simpler in all
          the comparisons.

          Added support for sub/super se/bag comparisons, thanks to Boris
          Sukholitko <bobatonhu@yahoo.co.uk>

          Added scalarref.t

0.081

          Got rid of struct mode for num()

          Large internal changes, now using a stack object rather than just an
          array.  This handles rendering the stack.

          The comparisons handle rendering the got and expected values now.

          num() and str() numify/stringify before comparing, this makes
          overload of == or eq irrelevant. This also prevents problems with the
          diag when something stringifies differently to it's numificiation or
          differently each time you look.

          fixed diag of overloaded refs to display the ref value, not the
          overloaded value

          nicer diags for booleans

0.08

          Slight doc fix

          Added coderef calling as a test

0.07

          Fixed number.t to skip strict test when if Scalar::Util is not right

          Major improvement of docs. No longer reads like it was written by a
          drunken badger.

0.06

          Overhaul of Test::Deep::descend, native types are now wrapped up in a
          Test::Deep:Cmp object, moves lots of logic out of descend

          Added ArrayLength, HashKeys, RefType, and Blessed comparisons

          All tests now use Test::NoWarnings

          Broke out descend tests into hash.t, array, regexpref.t, probably
          should break out more

          Updated version of Scalar::Util dependency, thanks to Steve Purkis

0.05

          No longer using overload::StrVal() for looking behind overloads as
          it's broken for Regexp refs in some versions of Perl.

0.04

          Documented bool and included the files!!

0.03

          cmp_deeply(undef, \"") calls overload::StrVal(undef)

          added bool test

          using Scalar::Util to get reftype and blessed class

          Added prereq to Makefile.PL
